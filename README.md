[Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/riccotti/riccotti.github.io/blob/master/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf)

I am a very determined and ambitious individual with a strong technical background and natural ability to lead. I am versatile, curios and able to think ''out of the box''. I like to work in team, and I seek a career in research in the field of data mining and machine learning to improve existing applications or proposing new ones through the extraction of new knowledge from data. I am currently a post-doc researcher at ISTI-CNR, Pisa and a member of the KDDLab, a joint research group with the Department of Computer Science University of Pisa. I won the IBM fellowship and I have been an intern in IBM Research Dublin, Ireland in 2015. My research interests are in personal data mining, clustering, explainable models, and analysis of transactional data.
